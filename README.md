IoT Platform for Elderly Health Monitoring
This project,which was a group project of university, presents an IoT-based platform designed to monitor the health and safety of elderly individuals, especially those with Alzheimer's or dementia. The system enables real-time tracking of vital signs (heart rate and blood oxygen levels) and GPS-based location monitoring, ensuring their wellbeing and alerting caregivers in case of anomalies.

Key Features
Wearable Device: Measures heart rate, blood oxygen, and GPS location; sends alerts via a Telegram bot.

Real-time Monitoring: Caregivers receive alerts for abnormal vitals or if the user exits a safe zone.

Communication: Uses MQTT (publish/subscribe) and REST APIs for efficient data flow.

Integration: Stores and visualizes health data using ThingSpeak.

Catalog System: Manages device/service configurations and user authentication.
