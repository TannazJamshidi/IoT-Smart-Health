'''
WearableDevice.py is a digital bracelet which is directly connected to the internet, it has a narrow space to 
put an eSIM inside it in order to connect the device to internet connection. It is a REST consumer of Catalogue to 
read the configuration of sensors. It compares the values of each sensor if they are out of range caregiver get an 
alert message through Telegram bot so Wearable device is a publisher and publishes the sensed data of heart rate 
through ("SmartHealth/{user_id}/heart_rate") and blood oxygen based on ("SmartHealth/{user_id}/blood_oxygen") 
to ThingSpeak Adaptor and publishes data based on ("SmartHealth/{user_id}/danger/{data_type}") to 
Telegram bot for alerts in case patient gets out of zone or their heart rate or blood oxygen is out of standard range. 
The caregiver can get request for real-time values of heart rate and blood oxygen for the latest value. 
Also, it consists of three sensors:
1.	Heart Rate Sensor:
Unit of Measurement: Beats per Minute (BPM)
Normal Range for Elderly Individuals (Restin):
Resting heart rate can vary, but a typical range for elderly individuals at rest might be between 60 to 100 BPM. 
2.	GPS Sensor:
Unit of Measurement: Latitude and Longitude coordinates.
Normal range is the 500 meters from the patientâ€™s house.
3.	Blood Oxygen Sensor (Pulse Oximeter):
Unit of Measurement: Percentage of Oxygen Saturation in Hemoglobin (% SpO2)
Normal Range for Elderly Individuals: A normal range for blood oxygen saturation is typically considered to be 
between 90% and 100%.
